# 🎬 Netflix Scene Finder Clone

A visually accurate clone of the Netflix website, built for a hackathon challenge. Alongside a pixel-perfect UI, this project introduces a unique feature:

## New Feature: Scene Finder from Screenshot

Ever watched a scene and wondered where it's from? Now you can upload a **screenshot**, and our mock feature will tell you the **movie/show name** and even give a **timestamp** of where that scene appears.

This feature uses fake/mock logic for demo purposes — no real AI processing is used.
